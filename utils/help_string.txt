ESSENTIAL SCORING ARGUMENTS
	-receptor:
Filepath for receptor pdbqt. If a single file is supplied, this    is used as the receptor for all supplied ligands. If directory is supplied, it is assumed to be a directory of directories each containing a protein.pdbqt and ligand.pdbqt file which will be scored in pairss

	-ligand:
Filepath for ligand pdbqt. If a single pdbqt file is supplied,    this is used as the ligand for the supplied receptor. If a directory is supplied alongside a single receptor file, it is assumed to be a directory of ligands to score against a single receptor. If the supplied directory is identical to the supplied receptor directory, it is assumed to be a directory of directories each containing a protein.pdbqt and ligand.pdbqt file which will be scored in pairs. If smiles are supplied in .txt or .smi format, they are docked using the protocol described in the publication.

ESSENTIAL DOCKING ARGUMENTS

EITHER:
	-ref_lig:
A crystallographic or docked reference ligand in .pdb, .pdbqt,  .mol, .mol2 or .sdf format

OR:
	-center:
Coordinates of the center of the binding site for docking in the format '[x, y, z]'

        -range:
Size in angstroms of the box for docking around the center point   in the format '[x, y, z]'

OPTIONAL SCORING ARGUMENTS
        -out:
Filepath of .csv file to save scoring results (Default MLScoring/output/Results.csv)

	-pose_1:
If supplied, only the first pose for each supplied ligand is     scored (Default all pqbdt poses are scored)

	-threads:
Number of threads to parallelise scoring over (Default 1)

PARAMETER FILES:

	-utils/dock_settings.json:
File containing GWOVina settings for preparing and docking       ligands in SMILE format.
