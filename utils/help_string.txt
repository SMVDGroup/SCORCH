ESSENTIAL SCORING ARGUMENTS
	-receptor:
Filepath for receptor pdbqt. If a single file is supplied, this    is used as the receptor for all supplied ligands. If directory is supplied, it is assumed to be a directory of directories each containing a protein.pdbqt and ligand.pdbqt file which will be scored in pairss

	-ligand:
Filepath for ligand pdbqt. If a single pdbqt file is supplied,    this is used as the ligand for the supplied receptor. If a directory is supplied alongside a single receptor file, it is assumed to be a directory of ligands to score against a single receptor. If the supplied directory is identical to the supplied receptor directory, it is assumed to be a directory of directories each containing a protein.pdbqt and ligand.pdbqt file which will be scored in pairs. If smiles are supplied in .txt or .smi format, they are docked using the protocol described in the publication. 

ESSENTIAL DOCKING ARGUMENTS

	-ref_lig:
If ligands are supplied in .smi format for scoring, a reference ligand is required for docking in .pdb or .pdbqt format

OPTIONAL SCORING ARGUMENTS
        -out:
Filepath of .csv file to save scoring results (Default MLScoring/output/Results.csv)

	-pose_1:
If supplied, only the first pose for each supplied ligand is     scored (Default all pqbdt poses are scored)

	-threads:
Number of threads to parallelise scoring over (Default 1)

	-num_networks:
Number of networks to query for neural network based models    (Default 10)

	-mlpscore:
If supplied, complexes are only scored with sequential neural network model (Default consensus of mlpscore, widedeepscore, xgbscore)

	-widedeepscore:
If supplied, complexes are only scored with wide and deep neural network model (Default consensus of mlpscore, widedeepscore, xgbscore)

	-xgbscore:
If supplied, complexes are only scored with xgboost model    (Default consensus of mlpscore, widedeepscore, xgbscore)


PARAMETER FILES:

	-utils/dock_settings.json:
File containing filepaths for GWOVina and MGLTools 1.5.6 local installations, as well as GWOVina settings for preparing and docking ligands in SMILE format.
